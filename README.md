### Code explanation

The code itself is pretty easy to understand. But I want to explain my choice of the hamburger "button" not being inside the navbar.
For me it is more logical to have it outside the navbar so you can use the full width of the phone screen(or similiar) to go to a section.
When the navbar is hidden the hamburger does not interfere with the reading experience.
